# Stretchy
Stretchy is an application written in a team with senior android developer,
which is used to create and execute stretching sequences.

The user can add his own stretching workout with the names of the exercises
and their length. Once added, a workout can be executed multiple times.

A 5 second break is automatically added between exercises, during which the
speaker announces the name of the next exercise so that the user does not
have to look at the phone.

It is possible to export and import the training to a file.

Technologies used: Dagger 2, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Gson and ROOM.
Application architecture is MVVM

The current look of the app:
